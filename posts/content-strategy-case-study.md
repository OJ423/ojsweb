Synergy Occupational Hygiene is a UK-based consultancy that helps businesses manage workplace health risks through expert assessments, monitoring, and guidance. Their mission is to make working environments safer — from factory floors to construction sites — and their services are trusted across the public and private sectors.

I’ve been supporting Synergy with their digital marketing strategy, helping to raise awareness of the crucial work they do. This includes optimising their website for search, producing informative content, and making sure they’re visible when businesses are searching for occupational hygiene expertise online.

## A Practical, Science-Led Service
Occupational hygiene plays a vital role in protecting employee health, yet it's an area many businesses only discover when regulations require them to act. My work with Synergy is focused on helping them reach those who need to act before issues arise — by clearly explaining what they do and how it helps.

A big part of occupational hygiene centres around the UK’s Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations 2002. While most people associate hazardous substances with strong chemicals, COSHH also covers everyday materials that can pose serious health risks over time — including things like wood dust, flour dust, or welding fumes.

Understanding and managing these risks can be complex, which is where professional support makes a difference. A trusted [COSHH Risk Assessment](https://occupational-hygiene.co.uk/coshh-assessment/) provider like Synergy Occupational Hygiene helps businesses cut through the confusion and take practical steps toward full COSHH compliance — so they can protect their people and meet their legal obligations with confidence.

Whether it's [air quality testing](https://occupational-hygiene.co.uk/workplace-air-monitoring/) to monitor exposure to harmful substances, noise surveys to protect hearing, or hand arm vibration assessments to prevent long-term conditions like [HAVS](https://occupational-hygiene.co.uk/hand-arm-vibration-testing-and-assessment/), Synergy’s team delivers data-backed insights businesses can rely on.

## A Website That Works for Search and for People
Together, we’ve worked on:

- Clarifying services so decision-makers understand the value
- Improving technical SEO so Synergy ranks for key terms
- Creating helpful, informative content that builds trust

The result? A website that not only looks professional but also works hard behind the scenes — attracting relevant traffic, reducing bounce rates, and encouraging enquiries.

If you’re a specialist service provider looking to improve your online presence, I’d love to hear from you. I combine SEO expertise with a deep understanding of how to position technical or niche services for the audiences who need them most.
