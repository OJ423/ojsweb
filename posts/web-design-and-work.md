## The Future of AI and VectorLink’s Role in Helping Businesses Effectively Use LLMs

I recently completed a project for an AI consultancy called [VectorLink](https://vectorlink.ai). They blew my mind with some of the things they are doing and how damn clever they are. I would go as far as to say they are the smartest people I have ever had the pleasure to meet. Not just clever though, friendly and fantastic at explaining complicated subjects to a Luddite like me.

I was so blown away that I thought I’d do a quick write-up of what they do as I really do believe that any businesses that is looking to use AI within their business would benefit from getting in touch with VectorLink.

I like AI and I’m not too concerned with it taking my job. It probably will do at some stage and our leaders won’t have a plan to deal with the unemployment it causes or the social unrest as people struggle to house and feed themselves. This is a topic for some sort of dystopian post in the future. AI, however, isn’t really intelligent. It’s just really good at understanding language, after all, it is a large language model and something like OpenAI has been trained on lots and lots of data. So in short, it knows a lot more shit than I do. But it is not capable of creating. That’s where we humans are better, it just regurgitates stuff that it has learnt.

VectorLink is using AI’s language skills in combination with their client’s data and importantly context around that data. This means that rather than making up some mindless babble that AI occasionally does when you push it out of its comfort zone, it becomes an expert in that business (a big disclaimer, if a business’ data is trash, the results will be equally as bad).

Many businesses have vast amounts of data and content, and making sense of it and using it to drive growth can be challenging. That’s where VectorLink comes in.

VectorLink’s expertise in [entity resolution](https://vectorlink.ai/entity-resolution/), [semantic search](https://vectorlink.ai/semantic-search/), and AI-driven processes allows businesses to take full advantage of their data. By converting unstructured data into vectors that LLMs can understand, businesses can tap into the parameterized knowledge of these models, enabling more accurate insights, predictions, and solutions tailored to their unique needs. Whether it’s identifying duplicate entities, enhancing customer insights through [Know Your Customer(KYC)](https://vectorlink.ai/know-your-customer/) services or implementing [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://vectorlink.ai/retrieval-augmented-generation/) to provide smarter search and data generation, VectorLink is enabling businesses to move into a future where AI doesn’t just augment tasks — it transforms them.

To put it into context, imagine a doctor with an AI assistant who has access to a medical data index and can query symptoms to diagnose a patient with a high degree of accuracy. Or law enforcement agencies that can cross-reference data, photos and various other criminal content to find patterns across different departments. Watch out criminals, AI is coming for you.

What is more, because large language models are text-based, using them to query data opens up this avenue to non-technical users. Traditionally, an overworked data team would need to use a programming language to find what someone in marketing or sales needs. This would involve loads of other tasks, like finding the information and getting it in a format to analyse. All time time-consuming, all a bottleneck and all an expensive drain on the business. Having the ability to use natural language to query data and content is a massive improvement and means anyone can prompt the machines to interrogate the data and drive insights and meaning.

With AI becoming an integral part of business strategies, the ability to harness the power of LLMs with custom data is becoming a competitive advantage. As more businesses embrace AI-driven tools like those provided by VectorLink, we’re seeing a shift in how companies operate, from data management to customer engagement. The future of AI is here, and VectorLink will help companies innovate and thrive in an increasingly AI-driven world.

## What did I do for VectorLink?

So what did I do? I can’t profess to understand the complex formulae and maths that go on behind the scenes, but I can make things look pretty, create compelling and optimised web copy and build an elegant and stylish website. My services for this project included content marketing, SEO and WordPress web design —

- Branding — Logo creation and supporting web images
- Optimised SEO web copy
- Web design (WordPress and Elementor for this project)
- I also ensured that the blog could be maintained in Markdown as developers much prefer to write in code rather than drag and drop interfaces.

If you want to work with me, please do get in touch. I’m friendly, a good communicator and very efficient. I also like to think I do a good job for my clients. You can contact me via my marketing services and web design skills.

Here’s some pictures of my work:

PS — there is an explanation about the formula I displayed at the top of this post in VectorLink’s [Leveraging LLMs and Machine Learning for Record Matching](https://vectorlink.ai/blog/leveraging-llms-and-machine-learning-for-record-matching/) blog
